# Project Proposal

I plan to create to a create a Tetris game. It would follow the standard gameplay of Tetris- randomly shaped blocks dropping from the top of the screen until a column reaches the top of the screen. I would use a library for the game engine.
Possible expansions include a high score table with names, the longest games (in terms of time in minutes/seconds), and possibly being able to insert a picture for the high score table, or allowing the user to select the color scheme of the blocks. 
I am looking on potentially using Oxygine( http://oxygine.org/ ) because the game can be run on the web without any plugins. Additonally, they offer a visual editior.
