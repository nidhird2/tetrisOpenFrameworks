# Project Proposal

I plan to create to a create a Tetris game. It would follow the standard gameplay of Tetris- randomly shaped blocks dropping from the top of the screen until a column reaches the top of the screen. I plan to keep a high score table. ofSoundPlayer (within OF) will be used for playing sounds (background music & sound effects).
Players should be able to see the upcoming piece and where their piece would land if spacebar is pressed.
Game will read and write to the text file to save the high scores from game to game.
